## Phase 1: Data Wrangling

`Step 1: Loading Data to MySQL Workbench`

1. Download the extract the .sql data files.
2. New Connection â†’ Rename Business Insights 360 â†’ Test the connection
3. Server â†’ Data Import â†’ Import from self-contained file â†’ Select the .sql files from directory â†’ Start Import â†’ Once import complete â†’ Check database in the Navigator Schema

`Step 2: Connecting MySQL Database to Power BI`

- Get Data â†’ MySQL Database â†’ Server: localhost & Database: gdb041 & gdb056 â†’ Load all the tables

## Phase 2: ETL with Power Query

`Step 1: Creating custom Date Table`

1. New Source â†’ Blank Query â†’ Custom M Code: = {Number.From(#date(2017,9,1))..Number.From(#date(2022,12,31))}â†’ Will create a list of date values â†’ Convert to Table â†’ Set Data type as Date â†’ Rename column as Date
2. Add columns â†’ Day, Day Name, Start of Week, Start of Month & Month Name.
3. Add Custom fiscal_year column using M code: Date.Year(Date.AddMonths([month],4))

   NOTE: This basically adds 4 months to the Date Month and then extracts the Year out of the result. Our financial year starts in Sep hence we add 4 months.
4. Filter out the fiscal_year column for 2023 values since we have incomplete data for it.

`Step 2: Creating Last Sales Month Reference Table`

1. Create a reference table from the fact_sales_monthly table. Extract the date column by editing the source step code to: #"gdb041 fact_sales_monthly"[date]
2. Calculate the Last Sales Month table by getting the maximum date value from the column using: = List.Max(#"gdb041 fact_sales_monthly"[date])

`Step 3: Creating Remaining Forecast Reference Table`

1. Create a reference table from the fact_forecast_monthly table. Sort the table ascending by date values.
2. Filter for all the data after the Last Sales Month value using M code: Table.SelectRows(Source, each ([date] > last_sales_month))

`Step 4: Creating a New Table with both Actual & Forecast Data`

1. Append the fact_sales monthly table and remaining_forecast table as a new table fact_actuals&estimates.
2. Rename sold_quantity (from fact_sales_monthly) and forecast_quantity (from remaining_forecast) as qty so the columns get merged into one column in the append operation.

`Step 5: Calculating Net Invoice Sales based on FY varying Gross Price & Pre-invoice Deductions`

Logic: Gross Price - Pre-invoice Deductions = Net Invoice Sales â†’ Net Invoice Sales - Post-invoice Deductions = Net Sales (will be done later)

1. Add a custom calculated column fiscal_year to the fact_actuals&estimates table to calculate the FY based on the date column using M code: Date.Year(Date.AddMonths([date],4))
2. Merge the fact_actuals&estimates table and the gross_price table based on 2 columns: product_code and fiscal_year with a Left Outer Join. Expand the merged columns to show only gross_price without the reference name. Set the data type as Currency. 
3. Add a custom calulated column gross_sales that is the product of gross_price and the qty sold columns. Set the data type as Currency.
4. Now Merge the fact_actuals&estimates table and the pre_invoice_deductions table based on 2 columns: customer_code and fiscal_year with a Left Outer Join. Expand the merged columns to show only pre_invoice_discount_pct without the reference name. Set the data type as Percentage.
5. Add a custom calculated column pre_invoice_discount that is the product of pre_invoice_discount_pct and gross_sales columns. Set the data type as Currency.
6. Add a custom calculated column net_invoice_sales that is the difference between gross_sales and pre_invoice_discount columns. Set the data type as Currency.
